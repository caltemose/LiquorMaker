LiquorMaker is a simple web page used for determining amounts of 
macerated hard alcohol and simple syrup (water + dissolved sugar) 
to mix in order to create homemade liquors of varying percentages.

This version is now functioning although it needs better error handling.

LiquorMaker is created and maintained by Chad Altemose.
