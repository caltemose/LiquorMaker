LiquorMaker is a simple web page used for determining amounts of 
macerated hard alcohol and simple syrup (water + dissolved sugar) 
to mix in order to create homemade liquors of varying percentages.

This version is now functioning although it needs better error handling.

LiquorMaker can be viewed at:
